					<h1>Hi Guys!</h1>
					<h3>
						Iâ€™m Peter Parker, a high school student from Queens, New York.<br />
						Iâ€™m a science nerd who loves engineering, <br />hanging out with my
						friends MJ and Ned,<br />
						and helping my community.<br />
						Lifeâ€™s busy, but Iâ€™m figuring it out one step at a time.

					<h2>Science nerd</h2>
					<p>
						First off, Iâ€™m a total science nerd. Physics, chemistry,
						engineeringâ€”you name it, Iâ€™m into it. Iâ€™ve spent countless late
						nights in my room tinkering with gadgets, running experiments, and
						(accidentally) blowing things up. Science is like a giant puzzle,
						and I love figuring out how the pieces fit together.

					<h2>Photography</h2>
					<p>
						When Iâ€™m not geeking out over tech, youâ€™ll probably find me with my
						camera. Photography has been a passion of mine for as long as I can
						remember. Thereâ€™s something about capturing a moment that tells a
						storyâ€”itâ€™s like freezing time. New York City is the perfect backdrop
						for that, with all its energy and life. Plus, I get to use my skills
						working freelance for The Daily Bugle.

				<div class="aboutMeText3">
					<h2>Music</h2>
					<p>
						Music? Iâ€™m all about the classicsâ€”stuff like Led Zeppelin, The
						Ramones, and a bit of AC/DC (I might have been influenced by a
						certain genius billionaire playboy philanthropist). Oh, and Iâ€™ve
						been known to hum the Spider-Man theme song once or twiceâ€”donâ€™t tell
						anyone.

			<div class="aboutMe4">
				<img src="images/Peter/Peter_StarWars.jpg" />
				<div class="aboutMeText4">
					<h2>Movies</h2>
					<p>
						Iâ€™m also a bit of a movie buff. I love old sci-fi and action
						flicksâ€”anything with cool gadgets or epic hero moments. Sometimes I
						imagine what it would be like to be the hero in those storiesâ€¦ not
						that Iâ€™d know anything about that.

			<div class="aboutMe5">
				<img src="images/Peter/Peter_friend4.jpg" />
				<div class="aboutMeText5">
					<h2>Friends</h2>
					<p>
						Other than that, I just like hanging out with my best friend Ned,
						grabbing sandwiches at Delmarâ€™s Deli, or exploring the city. Life is
						pretty chaotic sometimes, but I wouldnâ€™t trade it for anything.

					Anyway, thanks for stopping by my page. <br />If you ever need a

					clumsy.
